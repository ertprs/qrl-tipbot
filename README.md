> **THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!!** Things may change!



The QRL Tipbot has been developed to support multi-platform QRL (*Quantum Resistant Ledger*) tipping from user to user. Each user is given an address and all tips are handeled on-chain.

The bot has been built in NodeJS and utilizes multiple 3rd party libraries. If you are looking to run this bot for your self, please see the [Documentation](https://github.com/fr1t2/qrltips/_docs) for more info and to get started.


## Bot Usage

Interacting with the bot is simple, and instructions are given per service the tipbot supports. Typically you can simply send the bot a message similar to `@qrltips +help` for a full list of commands supported in that specific platform.

Depending on the platform, you will issue a message to the bot and the bot will interact with you. To get the help instructions see the tables below

| Service/Platform  | Bot Name  | Help Command  |  Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Discord | @qrltips | +help | Bot must be invited to the community to be able to interact. Talk to the server moderator for addition |

> Starting with Discord and will build into more as it goes.
